        <p class="lead mb-4">Thank you for taking the time to view my website. Hello, my name is Nancy and I am promoting a website for beginners who are interested in starting their own businesses. It was a journey to promote this website and to create a business. In the field on entrepreneurs, there are many people that turned something creative and unique to something successful. Relating to the customers is an important factor of selling your products because they are the reviewers that decide if they want to come back to your website for more or never look at it again. Entrepreneurs bear a lot of responsibilities by creating their own businesses. Turning your ideas into a sucessful business does not happen overnight. Therefore,learning about the challenges, risks, and benefits of starting your own business can enable a new insight towards your future. Finding the right businesses that are based on your passions, goals, and dreams will motivate you more compared to being an entrepreneur only satisfied with the outcome of money. Planning a business is crucial and it may take up to a couple of months to revise all the plans. Hence, there are many steps into becoming a successful entrepreneur.<br><br>

        When I created my own business, I had did not have any insight about the financial side, the creative side, or the process of creating a business. It felt like I was a fish out of water because I was frightened about the area of business since I had no knowledge of it. I developed ideas tht I was passionate about, however, I did not have any guidance from anybody. Therefore, I created this platform to help business owners learn about the positive and negative consequences of starting a business and how to pursue something that you are passionate about. I pursued a higher education and got my bachelor of arts in order to learn more about the business aspects in school. I attended an internship that enabled me to gain perspective about the business side of being an entrepreneur. It was difficult for me to start a business at first because I was hesistant that my ideas will be judged upon and not liked by any customers. <br><br>

        Therefore, I worked as a creative director at a business firm to give my creative input without being in the spotlight. However, after a couple of years, I decided this was not the job that I wanted to do anymore. I researched a whole ton about becoming an entrepreneur and there were many websites and vidoes that I have wathced. I realized that there isn't one website that had all of the necessary information of knowing all the postive and negative aspects of being a part of a business. Therefore, my company was born; creating a better environment to help start-up comapnies succeed to their potentials and provide feedback in order to improve the creative side of the business. Now, after learning all from my failures and successses, I want to guide new entrepreneurs to create their own company and have a chance to succeed.
